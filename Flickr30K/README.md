# Preprocessing Flickr30K entities

## Downloading the dataset

Source website - http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~bplumme2/Flickr30kEntities/

When I downloaded it, there were issues with the website and the dataset was being shared via a Google drive link, from which I had to download it manually.
I downloaded a file called flickr30k_images.tar.gz

```bash
DATASET_DIR=<path_to_directory_containing_downloaded_dataset>
./unzip.sh $DATASET_DIR
```
